# CSV-Searching-Program
The program searches through a CSV list with each row containing an artist, all of their songs, and each of those songs' lyrics. It then generates a description of each artist and their average word count per song, the total vocabulary size, and the number of songs. Lastly, the user can search up any word and see which artists have used them in their songs. Just run the CSV_Program.py file.

# How To use
The program will ask for the txt filename of "stopwords" to use. These stopwords are words that can't be searched for in songs.
Then the program will ask for csv filename containing songdata.

These files are provided.
